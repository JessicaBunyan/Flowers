address the TODOs in code

Animations

the animations will make or break this 

stop messing with the animations in code, need to go design mode -

some Qs about interactions - need to see what is underneath petal (Rock or flowerbud) and also need to just think about the animation
need to think as well about the look/feel for the game - flowers looking more flowery means the path is less pathy
